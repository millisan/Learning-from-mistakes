Code and example data to run the prediction method introduced in the paper. Overview of the algorithm is given in ReadMe.pdf. Data of example simulation 32 are given in G.txt (G-matrix in generation 1), P.txt (P-matrix in generation 1), mu.txt (means of the 5 traits for the 30 generations) and s.txt (selection differential for the 30 generations).
